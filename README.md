This is a set of mudlet scripts, triggers and aliases for Mudlet and Realms of Despair.

The triggers are a bit harder - to get the fight trackers to work, you may have to edit the regular expressions they are watching for to see your prompt and recognize the difference between the regular prompt and in-fight prompts.
The aliases are all self-explanatory in how they work - just type the string the alias is waiting for.
The scripts are initialization and helper functions for the triggers and aliases.  Instructive to read.

To use this repository, download it and use Mudlet's package installer to import the zip file.  To get rid of it, use the package installer to uninstall it.

Raise issues and bugs please and I'll look into them.

Oh, in case I forget, this is at \CJH\Misc\Games\CJH_Mudlet_Git
